# ccrypto_bot

To run this bot a few things are necessary. First you need to get your own API key. To do this look into Telegrams BotFather. Once you have the key for your bot create a .py file called keys.py. In this file you should have something like `bot_key = "KEY GOES HERE"`. In bot.py we will import keys and use `keys.bot_key` to run the bot.

You also will need to install requirements.txt. This can be done through `pip install requirements.txt`. I don't remember the exact command off the top of my head so this could be wrong. This will install the necessary python libraries via pip.
